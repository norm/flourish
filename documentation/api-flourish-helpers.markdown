# Template helpers

## Get dates for navigation

```python
from flourish.helpers import all_valid_dates

all_valid_dates(flourish, 'updated')
```

In order to build date-based navigation for your site, you need to know what
dates contain sources. `all_valid_dates(flourish, key)` returns a list of
dicts containing years, months, and days for which any source that has a
datetime in `key`.

The first argument is your flourish instance.

The second argument is which key to use to find the dates. It is optional, and
the default is `'published'` (which is one of the 
[special keys](/adding-sources/#special-keys-in-sources) in Flourish).

The return value looks like:

```python
{
    'year': '2015',
    'months': [
        {
            'month': '12',
            'days': [
                {'day': '25'},
            ],
        },
    ],
},
```

## Get the publication year range

```python
from flourish.helpers import publication_range

publication_range(flourish, 'updated')
```

`publication_range(flourish, key)` will return a string like `2012â€“2016`,
for the years of any source that has a datetime in `key`. This is useful for
creating the copyright line in a site's footer.

The first argument is your flourish instance.

The second argument is which key to use to find the dates. It is optional, and
the default is `'published'` (which is one of the 
[special keys](/adding-sources/#special-keys-in-sources) in Flourish).

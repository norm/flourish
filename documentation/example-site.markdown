# The example site

Now that you have [installed Flourish](/installing/), you can quickly get a
feel for using it by creating a new directory on your computer, and running
`flourish example` from within:

```bash
mkdir testing
cd testing
flourish example
```

This will create some source files and templates, then instruct you to
run `flourish --rebuild server` and open [http://localhost:3567/][lh]
in your browser to continue.

The example site briefly walks you through editing content and creating
new pages in a Flourish-driven site.

[lh]: http://localhost:3567/

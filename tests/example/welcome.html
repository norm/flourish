  <h1>Welcome to your new blog</h1>
  <p>Welcome to your new blog, powered by Flourish. This example content will
walk you through the basics of getting started using Flourish.</p>

<p>Try clicking around the site. See how the title at the top of the page always
takes you to the homepage and that there are three posts linked from there;
that "2016" takes you to a similar list of pages, but the "06" and "07" links
show less links? These links are all programmatically generated from the
site's source.</p>

<p>The homepage links to all pages, the "2016" page links to all pages published
in the year 2016, and "06" and "07" link to pages published in June and July
of that year.</p>

<p>Having familiarised yourself with the site as it is now, let's start

# How Flourish works

Flourish generates websites by passing content ("source") through templates
to create pages that you define (rather than only those provided in the code,
or by adding a plugin).

In order to create a website with Flourish, you will need three directories:

  * `source` — contains the [sources of the pages](/adding-sources/),
    the [site configuration](/site-configuration/) and
    [generation script](/generating-the-site)
  * `templates` — contains the wrapper HTML used to convert the sources into 
    webpages
  * `output` — contains the generated website

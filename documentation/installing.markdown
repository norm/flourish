# Installing Flourish

Flourish is written in python, and is installable with the `pip` command:


```bash
$ pip install flourish
```

...or `easy_install` if `pip` is not installed on your computer:

```bash
$ pip install flourish
pip: command not found
$ easy_install flourish
```

You may need to prefix the command with `sudo` if you get a "permission 
denied" error.

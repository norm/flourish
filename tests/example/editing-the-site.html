  <h1>Editing the site</h1>
  <p>To learn more about editing a Flourish powered web site, first open the
directory you ran <code>flourish example</code> in into your text editor. Open the file
<code>editing-the-site.markdown</code> in the <code>source</code> directory. This file contains
Markdown that Flourish uses to create the web page you are reading.</p>

<p>Add, change or delete some of the words in this paragraph, save the file
and reload the page in your browser to see the changes take effect. When you
are creating the content for your new Flourish site, this is how you can
preview it as you write.</p>

<h2>Changing the site-wide configuration</h2>

<p>There is a file <code>_site.toml</code> in the <code>source</code> directory. It is not the source
for any specific page, but rather it is site-wide configuration.</p>

<p>Open it in your text editor and change the text "Your Name Goes Here" to
contain your name, save the file, reload this webpage and scroll to the
bottom. You'll see your name appear in the copyright statement in the footer.</p>

<p>Now you have a flavour of how to see your changes take effect,
let's <a href="/adding-pages">add a new page</a>.</p>
